# Plan

- First complete the exercise - only write tests after. This is because the exercise has incremental things to do, so what do we test for until it isn't completed (?)



### Thoughts

- Exercise to re-send post request html content. Is using two buffers the way to go? (Answer: No, something like io.Copy makes things much simpler)
