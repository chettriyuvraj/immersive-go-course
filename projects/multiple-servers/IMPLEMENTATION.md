# Implementation

Setting up a scaled-down version of this exercise, so as to focus on the important aspects

## Modules and packages

- Create a directory skeleton, ignore extras such as flags and environment configs

## Static server

- Again, ignore extras but get the server serving a file system using http.FileServer()
